# CS214-Planner
**CS214 Final Project**

This project is a Trip Planning API that implements three main functions:

1. **locate-all**: Finds all query positions in the map region given a specific category.
2. **plan-route**: Takes a starting position and the name of the final destination, then uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to calculate the shortest path between the two positions.
3. **find-nearby**: Accepts a starting position, a category of interest, and a depth of search, returning a list of the specified number of nearby positions of interest, if they exist within the map.
